Overview of Project:

Text documents, such as long recordings and meeting transcripts, are usually comprised of topically coherent text segments, each of which contains some number of text passages. Within each topically coherent segment, one would expect that the word usage demonstrates more consistent lexical distributions than that across segments. A linear partition of texts into topic segments can be used for text analysis tasks, such as passage retrieval in IR, document summarization, and discourse analysis. In this assessment, you are required to write Python code to preprocess a set of meeting transcripts and convert
them into numerical representations suitable for input into topic segmentation algorithms.
