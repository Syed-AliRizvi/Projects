This includes the python code for a Free Cell card game. This implementation does not follow all rules of the game, however, it allows the following:

-Moving Cards between cascades according to colour and hierarchy.

-Place cards in free cell slots.

-Place cards in home cell slots.

The implementation has been done in Python object-oriented style programming using Python Classes. Different scripts have been created for the card and deck classes which are then imported in the final script in order to play the game.

The report file has been included that explains the code in detail.
